## gameoflife-factory

a small webapp to make [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) gifs

### setup

You need a few things to make [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) work. These are instructions for my MacBook.

```
brew install pkg-config cairo libpng jpeg giflib
npm install
npm start
```

### usage

Use the UI to toggle cells, clear the whole thing, and check your animation. If you think it's rad, click the "GIF" button and see a GIF open in a new tab.
